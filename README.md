# Machine Learning Pipeline

This project implements a complete Machine Learning pipeline that automates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction. The pipeline ensures reproducibility, scalability, and efficiency in building ML solutions.

##  Features

* Data preprocessing (cleaning, handling missing values, encoding)
* Feature engineering and selection
* Model training and hyperparameter tuning
* Evaluation using standard ML metrics
* Deployment-ready prediction pipeline

```

##  Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML-Pipeline.git
cd ML-Pipeline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##  Usage

Run preprocessing, training, and evaluation:

```bash
python src/preprocessing.py
python src/train.py
python src/evaluate.py
```

For predictions on new data:

```bash
python src/predict.py --input new_data.csv
```

##  Results

* Achieved \[insert metric, e.g., 92% accuracy / RMSE score] on test dataset
* Pipeline modularity allows quick model switching and retraining
